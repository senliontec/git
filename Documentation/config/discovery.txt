discovery.bare::
	Specifies what kinds of directories Git can recognize as a bare
	repository when looking for the repository (aka repository
	discovery). This has no effect if repository discovery is not
	performed e.g. the path to the repository is set via `--git-dir`
	(see linkgit:git[1]).
+
This config setting is only respected when specified in a system or global
config, not when it is specified in a repository config or via the command
line option `-c discovery.bare=<value>`.
+
The currently supported values are `always` (Git always recognizes bare
repositories), `cwd` (Git only recognizes bare repositories if they are the
current working directory) and `never` (Git never recognizes bare
repositories). This defaults to `always`, but this default is likely to
change.
+
If your workflow does not rely on bare repositories, it is recommended that
you set this value to `never`. This makes repository discovery easier to
reason about and prevents certain types of security and non-security
problems, such as:

* `git clone`-ing a repository containing a malicious bare repository
  inside it.
* Git recognizing a directory that isn't meant to be a bare repository,
  but happens to look like one.
